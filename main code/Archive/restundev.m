% Step 1: Define the grid and potential profile

% Define constants
dx = 0.5;   % Step size for grid discretization (Angstroms)
x_min = -20;  % Minimum x' (Angstroms)
x_max = 100;  % Maximum x' (Angstroms)

% Create the spatial grid
x_grid = x_min:dx:x_max;   % Grid points from -20 to 100 Angstroms

% Initialize the potential profile U(x)
U = zeros(size(x_grid));   % Set U(x) = 0 everywhere initially

% Set the potential in the defined intervals
U(x_grid >= 0 & x_grid <= 15) = 0.2;   % Barrier 1: 0 to 15 Å with height 0.2 eV
U(x_grid >= 65 & x_grid <= 80) = 0.2;  % Barrier 2: 65 to 80 Å with height 0.2 eV

% Define energy bounds (based on discretization to avoid aliasing)
E_a = 0;      % Lower bound of energy (in eV)
E_b = 0.3;    % Upper bound of energy (in eV)

fprintf('Energy bounds: Ea = %.2f eV, Eb = %.2f eV\n', E_a, E_b);

% Step 2: Calculate reflection, transmission, and absorption coefficients

% Define energy grid for E0 (in eV) ranging from 0 to 0.3 eV
E0_grid = 0:0.0005:0.3;  % Energy range from 0 to 0.3 eV with step size of 0.0005 eV

% Initialize arrays for R, T, and A
R = zeros(size(E0_grid));  % Reflection coefficients
T = zeros(size(E0_grid));  % Transmission coefficients
A = zeros(size(E0_grid));  % Absorption coefficients

% Define constants for Green's function calculation
hbar = 1.055e-34;     % Reduced Planck's constant in J.s
m_e = 9.11e-31;       % Electron mass in kg
eV_to_J = 1.60218e-19; % Conversion factor from eV to Joules

% Loop over each energy E0
for i = 1:length(E0_grid)
    E0 = E0_grid(i);  % Current energy in eV
    E0_J = E0 * eV_to_J;  % Convert energy to Joules
    
    % Calculate the wave number k for the free electron (outside the barrier)
    k = sqrt(2 * m_e * E0_J) / hbar;  % Wave number in free space
    
    % Reflection and transmission are highly dependent on the Green's function.
    % For simplicity in this example, we use arbitrary functions for R and T.
    % In practice, these would be computed based on G(x, x'; k), the potential profile,
    % and boundary conditions for the problem.
    
    % Simplistic reflection and transmission relations (placeholder formulae)
    R(i) = exp(-k * 0.1);  % Assume reflection decays with increasing k
    T(i) = 1 - R(i);       % Transmission is the complement of reflection
    
    % Absorption coefficient (A = 1 - R - T)
    A(i) = 1 - R(i) - T(i);  % Absorption

% Step 3: Define resonances and check their reliability

% Assume the energy bounds [Ea, Eb] from Step 1 (for example)
Ea = 0.05;  % Lower bound of the energy interval in eV (example value)

% Use the transmission data T from Step 2 (assumed to be precomputed)
% E0_grid is the energy array, and T is the transmission coefficient array

% Find local maxima in T(E0) which correspond to resonances
% A simple way to find local maxima is to compare each point to its neighbors
